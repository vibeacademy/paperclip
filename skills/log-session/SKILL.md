# Log Session

Write a session journal for the current development session and save it to `reports/session-journals/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

If a journal already exists for today's date, append a session number suffix (e.g., `2026-02-15-2.md`).

## What to Capture

### 1. Session Summary (2-3 sentences)
High-level narrative of what the session accomplished and its strategic significance.

### 2. Tickets Delivered
For each ticket completed (merged to main) during this session:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Ticket # and title | Issue number and short description |
| PR # | Pull request number |
| What changed | 1-2 sentence summary of the implementation |
| Files touched | Key files modified (not exhaustive) |
| Tests added | Count and nature of new tests |

### 3. Tickets In Review
Same format as above, but for PRs that are created and reviewed but not yet merged.

### 4. Challenges and Mitigations
Document every significant obstacle encountered and how it was resolved:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Challenge | What went wrong or blocked progress |
| Root cause | Why it happened |
| Mitigation | How it was resolved |
| Prevention | What would prevent this in the future (if applicable) |

Examples: merge conflicts, CI failures, migration errors, test failures, architectural decisions that needed revision.

### 5. Insights and Learnings
Capture knowledge that will help in future sessions:
- **Technical insights** — patterns discovered, gotchas identified, architecture decisions
- **Process insights** — workflow improvements, efficiency gains, bottlenecks identified
- **Domain insights** — business logic clarifications, product understanding

These should be concrete and actionable, not generic observations.

### 6. Tickets Created
New tickets created during the session with brief context on why they were created.

### 7. Metrics
Quick quantitative summary:
- PRs created / merged / reviewed
- Tickets completed / created
- Tests added
- Board state changes

### 8. Next Up
Prioritized list of what should be tackled next, with context on dependencies and blockers.

## Format

Use the template structure from existing journals in `reports/session-journals/`. Keep the tone factual and concise — this is a working document for project continuity, not a blog post.

## After Writing

1. Read the journal back to verify completeness
2. Cross-reference against the git log and board state to catch anything missed
3. Present a brief summary to the user
